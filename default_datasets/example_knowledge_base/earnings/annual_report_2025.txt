LETTER FROM THE CEO

Dear Stakeholders,

As I reflect on 2025, I am incredibly proud of what our team accomplished. We didn't just grow—we transformed our business and expanded our impact on how organizations leverage data.

The integration of advanced AI into our platform represents a fundamental shift in analytics. With our natural language interface, business users can now ask complex questions and receive sophisticated analyses without SQL knowledge or data science expertise. This democratization of analytics is precisely what we envisioned when we founded ACME.

Our customer success stories demonstrate the real-world impact of our technology:
- A healthcare network reduced emergency room wait times by 31%
- A logistics company cut fuel costs by 18% through AI-powered route optimization
- An insurance company identified $47 million in fraudulent claims

These outcomes validate our product vision and fuel our determination to push boundaries further.

Looking ahead to 2026, we will focus on three key priorities:

First, we will continue innovating in AI and machine learning. Generative AI represents the next frontier, and we are investing heavily to lead this transformation.

Second, we will accelerate international expansion. With international revenue now at 42% of total, we see tremendous opportunity in EMEA and APAC markets.

Third, we will deepen our industry expertise through vertical solutions. Our healthcare, financial services, retail, and manufacturing customers have unique needs that we are positioned to address with purpose-built solutions.

I want to thank our 5,612 employees worldwide for their dedication and innovation. Our culture of excellence, collaboration, and customer obsession drives everything we achieve.

To our customers, thank you for trusting us with your most important data and analytics needs. Your success is our success.

To our shareholders, thank you for your continued confidence in our vision. We are committed to delivering sustainable, profitable growth and long-term value creation.

The future of data analytics is bright, and ACME will lead the way.

Sincerely,
Sarah Mitchell
Chief Executive Officer
