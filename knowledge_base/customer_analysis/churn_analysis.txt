CONCLUSION

ACME's customer retention metrics remain strong relative to industry benchmarks, with 93% logo retention and 126% net revenue retention. Our enterprise segment performs exceptionally well at 97% retention, while opportunities exist to improve retention in mid-market (94%) and small business (88%) segments.

The primary drivers of churn are budget constraints and low product adoption, both addressable through enhanced customer success initiatives and product improvements. Our early warning system and health scoring model effectively identify at-risk customers, allowing proactive intervention.

Looking ahead to 2026, focused execution on the six strategic priorities outlined above should drive retention improvements of 1-2 percentage points across segments, representing $50-80M in saved ARR annually. Combined with continued expansion success, this positions ACME to sustain net revenue retention above 125% while growing the customer base.
